# DeepLearning Homeworks

These are the programming assignments that were given to us during our Deep Learning class. You can find the assignment description in the appropriate assignment folder. 
We couldn't upload the datasets on the repository but the following datasets have been used for each homework.

1. Homework 1: Fashion MNIST 
2. Homework 2: CIFAR-100 (Pre training on ImageNet)
3. Homework 3: Reinforcement learning on Atari 2000 Sequest (Uses the OpenAI Gym environment)

**NOTE: Don't copy the code from this repository if you have an assignment. Use this repository code as a guideline to approach your homework.**
